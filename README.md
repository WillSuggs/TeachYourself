## Daily exercises
  * Spend 15 minutes a day trying to solve one of the java problems on this site [codingbat](https://codingbat.com/prob/p187868)
  * Spend 15 minutes a day researching/learning about the topics above i.e. what is it, what is it used for, when should you use it, how to implement it?

  ## Time to build up your muscle memory â˜º
  * Once you are comfortable with the above material, go to this site and complete all of the exercises [Programming by Doing](https://programmingbydoing.com/)
  * Once you've completed all of this, email me and I'll provide you with your first project to build williesuggsdev@gmail.com.
